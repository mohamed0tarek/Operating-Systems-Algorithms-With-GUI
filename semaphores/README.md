# Semaphores

This directory contains implementations of semaphore concepts and applications. The following files are included:

- `semaphoers.py`: A simulation of semaphore concept using P and V operations. The user can specify the number of processes that want to access a shared resource. The output shows how these processes take and release the resource.
- `Read_Write.py`: An application of semaphores for handling readers and writers accessing a shared data. Multiple readers can read the data simultaneously, but while reading, no one can write. Similarly, when a writer is writing, no one can read or write until the writer finishes. The user can specify the number of readers and writers, and the output is a simulation of the interaction between readers and writers accessing the shared data.

## How to Use

To run the semaphore simulations and applications, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. From the main interface, choose semaphores or Read_Write.
4. Follow the specific instructions provided in the file to input the required parameters (e.g., number of processes, number of readers, number of writers).
5. Run the file to execute the semaphore simulation or application.
6. The output will display the simulation or application results based on the specified parameters.

## Dependencies

The semaphore simulations and applications are implemented using Python. Please ensure you have Python installed on your system.
