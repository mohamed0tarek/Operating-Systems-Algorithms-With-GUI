# Operating Systems Algorithms Implemented with GUI

This repository contains implementations of various operating system algorithms using a graphical user interface (GUI). The repository is organized into four directories: **"Semaphores," "Seek Algorithms," "Task Scheduling Algorithms," and "Task Scheduling Tests."** Each directory focuses on different aspects of operating system algorithms and is implemented using Python with Tkinter for the GUI.

## Semaphores

The **"Semaphores"** directory contains implementations of semaphore algorithms commonly used in operating systems. Semaphores are synchronization primitives that help manage concurrent access to shared resources. This directory includes examples and demonstrations of semaphore usage, along with the corresponding GUI elements to interact with and visualize semaphore operations.

## Seek Algorithms

The **"Seek Algorithms"** directory includes implementations of disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. These algorithms optimize the movement of the disk's read/write head to minimize seek time. The implementations in this directory utilize Tkinter to provide a user-friendly GUI for visualizing the disk scheduling algorithms and their effects on seek time.

## Task Scheduling Algorithms

In the **"Task Scheduling Algorithms"** directory, you'll find implementations of various task scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. These algorithms determine the order and priority in which processes or threads are executed. The GUI elements in this directory allow you to simulate and visualize the behavior of different task scheduling algorithms.

## Task Scheduling Tests

The **"Task Scheduling Tests"** directory contains test cases and evaluations for the implemented task scheduling algorithms. This directory provides scripts and utilities to measure and analyze the performance of the task scheduling algorithms in different scenarios. Each subdirectory inside "Task Scheduling Tests" focuses on a specific evaluation metric or test case.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms in this repository and access the GUI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3. Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed on your system.
4. Run the **`main.py`** file.
5. The main window of the GUI will appear, allowing you to select and interact with different operating system algorithms.

Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for more detailed instructions on running specific algorithms and utilizing the provided GUI.
